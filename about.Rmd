## Purpose

- We are trying to analyze the correlations between the state and age group 
corresponding with the different types of deaths.The Age input is dependant on State.
The Death input shows what type of death will be output on the graph. The checkbox
"Find Cost of Deaths?" calculates the cost in dollars of the death, based on the
amount that the US Government values a life ($10,041,645).
